CHANGELOG
=========

## master

- Fix #180: Existing selection highlighted by default on multi-value search results (thanks to
  @ahamid).

## 3.0.3

- Fix issue when a single-value Selectivity input is reset to null throught the React API.

## 3.0.2

- Fix #161: React API: Value should be re-set when the items change.

## 3.0.1

- Fix #156: Don't crash when unsubscribing from non-subscribed event listener.
- Don't rely on `react-dom-server` in React templates plugin to avoid issues with React 15.4.
- Fix #158: Expose Selectivity object as `$.Selectivity` in jQuery builds.
- Yarn compatibility: Get rid of peerDependencies.

## 3.0.0

- Made jQuery dependency fully optional.
  - As a result, all callbacks that received jQuery containers as argument(s) now receive plain DOM
    nodes instead.
- Added optional React API.
- Fix #128: Added NPM package.
- Added options:
  - `shouldOpenSubmenu()` - Callback that determines whether a submenu should be opened.
  - `selectable` - Allows to make items unselectable without having to disable them. This is mainly
                   useful for items that trigger submenus.
- Removed Bower and Component support.
- Moved option validation into its own plugin.
- Introduced the `"selectivity-change"` event. It's exactly the same as the `"change"` event (which
  is still supported as well) from version 2, but with the added benefit it cannot be confused with
  `"change"` events that bubble from internal `<input>` elements. The React API's `onChange`
  property uses the new event.
- Rewrote the AJAX plugin:
  - It now relies on the `fetch()` method for performing AJAX requests. This method is only
    available on modern browsers, so you'll need a polyfill if you want to use this with old
    browsers, unless you're using a jQuery build in which case the `jquery/ajax` plugin can provide
    a shim based on `$.ajax()` (requires jQuery 3.0 or higher).
  - Please check the documentation for the new options that can be passed.
- Renamed the option `suppressMouseWheelSelector` to just `suppressWheelSelector`.
- Renamed the `Selectivity.InputTypes` map to `Selectivity.Inputs`.
- Removed dist directory from the repository.
- Improved submenu positioning by automatically opening them on the left-hand side if there's
  insufficient space on the right side.
- Improve searching behavior with multiple submenus open.
- Fix #107: Remove the dropdown after timeout to fix "hover" behavior.
- Fix #136: Update original `<select>` element on "change" instead of "selectivity-selected".
- Fix: When a Selectivity instance is clicked but its dropdown should not open, at least it should
       be focused.
- Fix #144: Properly handle dynamically changing readOnly option.
- Fix #145: Make sure size detection works outside the DOM (thanks to @Rkokie). Also the
            ".selectivity-width-detector" element is no longer needed.
- Fix #146: Selectivity created from `<select>` element now uses "s9y_" prefix for its ID (thanks to
            @dr-itz).
- Fix: Provide correct offset in pagination when results are filtered.

## 2.1.0

- Implemented `disabled` property on items. When an item is disabled it cannot
  be selected and by default is rendered with grey text.
- PR #63: Fix problem with `closeOnSelect` behavior.
- PR #80: Added CSS classes for `hover` and `open` states.
- Fix #66: Respect `removeOnly` option when set after initialization.
- Fix #67: Pass `queryOptions` to `url` function in AJAX module.
- Fix #75: Make sure Enter key doesn't submit forms.
- Fix #93: Make the rerenderSelection() method public and document that
  `triggerChange: false` doesn't automatically update the UI.
- Fixed issue where the cursor position was constantly reset when using a
  tokenizer.
- Miscellaneous smaller fixes and styling tweaks.

## 2.0.0
